# About the project

My name is **Tuomas Heikkilä**. I am a Phd student in Media and Communication studies at University of Helsinki, working primarily with social media datasets and computational social sciences methods, that command fluency in API querying, web scraping, data wrangling, data visualization and (light) statistical analaysis  - all skills this course can hopefully help me with.

I am especially looking forward to kickstarting my R skills, having already some experience with python. 

You can find [my GitHub repository here](https://github.com/tuohmas/IODS-project).
