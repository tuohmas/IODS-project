# SUMMARY OF THE DATA SETS #####################################################

# BPRS data consists of "40 male subjects who were randomly assigned to one of 
# two treatment groups and each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric 
# rating scale (BPRS) BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) and then at
# weekly intervals for eight weeks. The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom 
# constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; 
# each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe). 
# The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having schizophrenia. 
# (Vehkalahti and Everitt, 2019, p. 157, taken from Davis, 2002)

# In short form, BPRS variables are:
# $treatment : weather participant is assigned to treatment group 1 or 2
## $subject : unbique identifier
## $week0 : baseline measurment before treatment
## $week1 - week8 : weekly measure 1-8 weeks after the treatment. 

# Basing from weekly summaries alone, there seems to be a trend of decreasing
# means of measurements week after week.

# RATS is a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats (Crowder and Hand,
# 1990).

# In short form, RATS variables are:
# $ID : unique indentifier
# $Group :  1-3, each put on a different diets.
# $WD1 - WD64 : rat body weight (in grams), measured repeatedly over 9-week 
# period.
